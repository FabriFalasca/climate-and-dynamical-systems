# climate-and-dynamical-systems

The climate system is multiscale, high-dimensional and nonlinear. However, spatiotemporal recurrences of the system hint to the presence of low-dimensional manifolds containing the high-dimensional climate trajectory. These lower (than a full state space) objects are commonly referred to as attractors or intertial manfifolds (more on the Introduction section of this amazing thesis https://chaosbook.org/projects/gudorfThesis.pdf).
Climate is a nonlinear, dissipative system and, if trends are removed, we expect is trajectory to live on an attractor. Characterizing geometrical and topological properties of the climate attractor is an useful step for comprehensively characterize, investigate and study spatiotemporal climate fields. Furthermore, correctly resolving the attractor represents a useful step for evaluation of climate model outputs.

For now you will find metrics proposed by Valerio Lucarini, Davide Faranda &  friends in this book https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07006.pdf . The two metrics proposed quantify instaneous properties of high dimensional trajectories via the local dimension and stability. Lots of points to the literature can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03614.pdf . A paper adopting such metrics for atmospheric fields can be found here : https://www.nature.com/articles/srep41278 . A new paper applying the local dimension metric to ocean flows has been recently accepted in GRL and will be posted soon. 
In this repository we also add some algorithms for manifold learning that have been shown to be useful in climate applications, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03614.pdf*
