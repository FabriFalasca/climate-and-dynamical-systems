Two example where we run the local dimension and persistence metrics proposed by Valerio Lucarini, Davide Faranda & friends in this book https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07006.pdf .

First example: Lorenz_system. 
Here we simply run the metrics to quantify each state of the Lorenz system in chaotic regime. We do not integrate the system so long in time...the notebook is just there in order to showcase such metrics with a familiar example.

Second example: temperature in the tropical Pacific sector in the last 40 years. We use daily data from ERA5 reanalysis.
